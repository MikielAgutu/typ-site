It is accessed through a command line interface. Your first document We're going to make a PDF that looks like this: (See the sample project for the full PDF file) First install Typ. See Installation . Open a command line terminal. If Typ is not on your PATH , navigate to the installation folder from the terminal. Create a file called text.md . Open text.md and write something in Markdown. If you need inspiration, copy this: # Types, variables, and values C# is a strongly-typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method signature specifies a type for each input parameter and for the return value. Here's an example of some C# code: ```c# int a = 5; int b = a + 2; //OK bool test = true; // Error. Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'int' and 'bool'. int c = a + test; ``` Try and run it in your favorite IDE. Run typ typeset --inputFilepaths text.md . Using text.md , Typ will then create a formatted PDF called output.pdf . Notes for Linux users \ud83d\udea8 Make typ executable with chmod sudo chmod +x typ Typ depends on Python 3 on Linux It looks for Python 3 in #!/usr/bin/python3 You may need to run Typ with elevated permissions (e.g. with sudo ). sudo ./typ typeset --inputFilepaths text.md Typ should work with most desktop distributions like CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu, and derivatives It may perform differently on other versions Changing the output file You can use the --outputFilepath argument to change the output file name and location. Run typ typeset --inputFilepaths text.md --outputFilepath myDoc.pdf Typ will now produce a file called myDoc.pdf instead of output.pdf . Aliases Some command line arguments have short-hand aliases. --inputFilepaths is aliased by -i . --outputFilepath is aliased by -o . Run typ typeset -i text.md -o myDoc.pdf to see the aliases in action. Multiple files Typ can use multiple Markdown files to create a PDF. Files are combined in the order specified by the --inputFilepaths ( -i ) command line argument. Create a new file, post-script.md and add the contents: # Post script Thanks for reading! Run typ typeset -i text.md post-script.md -o myDoc.pdf . myDoc.pdf should contain content from text.md and post-script.md . Configure the formatting Typ gives you control over how your PDF is created through a set of configuration options. Let's use the --fontSize option from the command line. Run typ typeset -i text.md post-script.md -o myDoc.pdf --fontSize 36pt . You should see the difference by the way myDoc.pdf looks. Configuration files Typ can read configuration options from a file also. Create a new file called config.yaml and paste in the following: title: C# docs fontFamily: Arial pageSize: A5 pageMargin: 70pt 60pt 70pt textLineHeight: 150% fontSize: 18pt generateTableOfContents: false printPageNumbers: false printTitleMarginals: false Run typ typeset -i text.md post-script.md -o myDoc.pdf You should see the difference by the way myDoc.pdf looks. Note that options specified as command line arguments take precedence over those in configuration files. Projects For a work that consists of multiple files (front cover, multiple chapter files, preamble, etc), these should be stored in a single folder, termed a Project. A Project is just a normal folder on your file system that contains files that Typ can work with. By following this guide, you have created a Project already. Run typ typeset . Note the absence of command line arguments. Typ will create a PDF, output.pdf , with the combined contents of text.md and post-script.md . Notice the contents of post-script.md now appears before text.md . In this context, typ typeset will look for all the Markdown files in the working directory. The files are sorted in alphabetical order using the file name, and then combined. The combined text is then used to produce a formatted PDF. You'll have to use a naming convention to ensure the files appear in the correct order. For instance, rename text.md to 001-text.md , and post-script.md to 002.post-script.md . Run typ typeset again, and the text will be in the correct order.
