# Getting started

Typ turns plain Markdown into a formatted PDF, ready for print. It is accessed through a command line interface.

## Your first document

First install Typ. See [Installation](./usage/installation.md).

Open a command line terminal. If Typ is not on your `PATH`, navigate to the installation folder from the terminal.

Create a file called `text.md`.

Open `text.md` and write something in Markdown. If you need inspiration, copy this:

```markdown
# Types, variables, and values

C# is a strongly-typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method signature specifies a type for each input parameter and for the return value.

Here's an example of some C# code:

 ```c#
int a = 5;
int b = a + 2; //OK

bool test = true;

// Error. Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'int' and 'bool'.
int c = a + test;
 ```

Try and run it in your favorite IDE.
```

Run `typ typeset --inputFilepaths text.md`.

Using `text.md`, Typ will then create a formatted PDF called `output.pdf`.

### *Notes for Linux users* ðŸš¨

- Make `typ` executable with `chmod`
    - `sudo chmod +x typ`
- Typ depends on Python 3 on Linux
    - It looks for Python 3 in `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- You may need to run Typ with elevated permissions (e.g. with `sudo`).
    - `sudo ./typ typeset --inputFilepaths text.md`
- Typ has been tested on Ubuntu Linux
    - It may perform differently on other versions

### Changing the output file

You can use the `--outputFilepath` argument to change the output file name and location.

Run `typ typeset --inputFilepaths text.md --outputFilepath myDoc.pdf`

Typ will now produce a file called `myDoc.pdf` instead of `output.pdf`.

### Aliases

Some command line arguments have short-hand aliases.

`--inputFilepaths` is aliased by `-i`. `--outputFilepath` is aliased by `-o`.

Run `typ typeset -i text.md -o myDoc.pdf` to see the aliases in action.

### Multiple files

Typ can use multiple Markdown files to create a PDF.

Files are combined in the order specified by the `--inputFilepaths` (`-i`) command line argument.

Create a new file, `post-script.md` and add the contents:

```markdown
# Post script

Thanks for reading!
```

Run `typ typeset -i text.md post-script.md -o myDoc.pdf`.

`myDoc.pdf` should contain content from `text.md` and `post-script.md`.

### Configure the formatting

Typ gives you control over how your PDF is created through a set of configuration options.

Let's use the `--fontSize` option from the command line.

Run `typ typeset -i text.md post-script.md -o myDoc.pdf --fontSize 36pt`.

You should see the difference by the way `myDoc.pdf` looks.

### Configuration files

Typ can read configuration options from a file also.

Create a new file called `config.yaml` and paste in the following:

```yaml
title: C# docs
fontFamily: Arial
pageSize: A5
pageMargin: 70pt 60pt 70pt
textLineHeight: 150%
fontSize: 18pt
generateTableOfContents: false
printPageNumbers: false
printTitleMarginals: false
```

Run `typ typeset -i text.md post-script.md -o myDoc.pdf`

You should see the difference by the way `myDoc.pdf` looks.

Note that options specified as command line arguments take precedence over those in configuration files.

### Projects

For a work that consists of multiple files (front cover, multiple chapter files, preamble, etc), these should be stored in a single folder, termed a Project.

A Project is just a normal folder on your file system that contains files that Typ can work with.

By following this guide, you have created a Project already.

Run `typ typeset`. Note the absence of command line arguments.

Typ will create a PDF, `output.pdf`, with the combined contents of `text.md` and `post-script.md`.

Notice the contents of `post-script.md` now appears before `text.md`.

In this context, `typ typeset` will look for all the Markdown files in the working directory. The files are sorted in alphabetical order using the file name, and then combined. The combined text is then used to produce a formatted PDF.

You'll have to use a naming convention to ensure the files appear in the correct order. For instance, rename `text.md` to `001-text.md`, and `post-script.md` to `002.post-script.md`.

Run `typ typeset` again, and the text will be in the correct order.
