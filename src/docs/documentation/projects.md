# Projects

Typ expects a certain set of files to exist in order for it to work. Together, these files are called a 'Project'.

This page explains how to configure a Project.

## Creating a Project

- Create a new directory for your Project somewhere on disk
    - It's recommended that Typ Project files have their own exclusive directory
- Inside the Project directory, create files that match the file names and formats listed on this page
- Note that the file names should exactly match the documentation

## Project files

These are the files that Typ will expect to exist.
