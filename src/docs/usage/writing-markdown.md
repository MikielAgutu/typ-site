# Writing Markdown

Typ's philosophy is simple: when writing a book one must focus on content, not formatting.

Typ allows you to write your book's content in a simple, lightweight text format called Markdown.

When it comes to creating a print ready PDF, Typ allows you to configure the important parts of your book's appearance, like font style and page size.

Typ will combine your configuration with it's own sensible formatting style to produce the PDF.

Think of it like telling a professional typesetter roughly how you want it to look, and they go away and use their judgment to produce the actual document.
